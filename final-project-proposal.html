    display the days of the week starting from Sunday.

<h2>How did it go?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Originally, I had planned to simply take the user input and have it <br>
    display in a table.</li>
    <li>I ended up making a to do list with the help of css that was more effective<br>
    than what I had previously planned.</li>
    <li>If I had more time, I would figure out how to add date and time.<br> I would
    also like to have the data stored instead of it getting erased once the site is refreshed.</li>
</ul>
